- 7d: 3.88% MAPE, 56.6% directional üèÜ

---

### üöÄ LightGBM

**Strengths:**
- Best 1-day MAPE: 1.53%
- Slightly positive R¬≤ on 1d and 3d (rare for crypto!)
- **Fastest training time** (~2-3x faster than XGBoost)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Random Forest (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Strengths:**
- Simple to understand and implement

2. **Extrapolation failure**: RF averages training outputs, can't predict beyond training range
3. **High noise**: RF overfits to noise in volatile crypto markets
4. **Return-based targets**: RF struggles with small returns centered around 0

**Use Cases:**
- ‚ùå NOT recommended for crypto prediction
- ‚ùå Use gradient boosting instead

**Performance by Horizon:**
- 1d: 2.03% MAPE, 50.2% directional
- 3d: 3.70% MAPE, 46.3% directional ‚ùå
- 7d: 5.73% MAPE, 46.3% directional ‚ùå

## Key Insights

### 1. Gradient Boosting Dominance

All three gradient boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) achieve **identical average MAPE of 2.67%**, significantly better than Random Forest's 3.82%.

**Why gradient boosting works better:**
- Can extrapolate beyond training data
- Handles non-stationary time series better
- Less prone to overfitting with proper regularization
- Better captures complex non-linear patterns

---

### 2. Random Forest Overfitting

Random Forest shows severe overfitting as prediction horizon increases:

| Horizon | Test R¬≤ | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| 1d | -0.40 | Mild overfitting |
| 3d | -0.67 | Moderate overfitting |
| 7d | **-0.93** | **Severe overfitting** |

Negative R¬≤ means the model performs **worse than predicting the mean**.

---

### 3. Directional Accuracy Patterns

| Model | 1d | 3d | 7d | Pattern |
|-------|----|----|----|---------|
| XGBoost | 51.4% | 55.3% | **56.6%** | ‚úÖ Improves with horizon |
| LightGBM | 51.4% | 55.3% | 51.2% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Drops on 7d |
| CatBoost | 51.4% | 55.3% | **56.6%** | ‚úÖ Improves with horizon |
| Random Forest | 50.2% | **46.3%** | **46.3%** | ‚ùå Worse than random |

**Insight:** XGBoost and CatBoost gain predictive edge on longer horizons, while Random Forest loses it entirely.

---

### 4. Speed vs Accuracy Trade-off

| Model | Training Time (relative) | MAPE | Best For |
|-------|-------------------------|------|----------|
| LightGBM | 1.0x (fastest) | 2.67% | High-frequency retraining |
| XGBoost | 2.5x | 2.67% | Best accuracy + directional |
| CatBoost | 3.0x | 2.67% | Categorical features |
| Random Forest | 2.0x | 3.82% | Not recommended |

- **Primary:** XGBoost or LightGBM (1.53% MAPE, 51.4% directional)
- **Backup:** CatBoost (1.53% MAPE, 51.4% directional)
- **Avoid:** Random Forest (2.03% MAPE, 50.2% directional)

#### 3-Day Predictions
- **Primary:** XGBoost (2.59% MAPE, 55.3% directional) üèÜ
- **Backup:** LightGBM or CatBoost (2.60% MAPE, 55.3% directional)
- **Avoid:** Random Forest (3.70% MAPE, 46.3% directional)

---

### üí° Model Selection Strategy

#### Strategy 1: Single Model (Simplest)

**Use XGBoost for all horizons**
- Pros: Simplest deployment, consistent performance
- Cons: Miss out on ensemble benefits
- Best for: MVP, proof of concept

#### Strategy 2: Horizon-Specific (Optimized)

**Use different models per horizon:**
- 1d: LightGBM (fastest, best MAPE)
- 3d: XGBoost (best MAPE + directional)
- 7d: XGBoost (best MAPE + directional)

- Pros: Optimal performance per horizon
- Cons: More complex deployment
- Best for: Production system

#### Strategy 3: Ensemble (RECOMMENDED for Production)

**Average predictions from XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost**

```python
# Pseudo-code
prediction_ensemble = (
    0.40 * xgboost_prediction +
    0.30 * lightgbm_prediction +
    0.30 * catboost_prediction
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces individual model variance
- More robust to market regime changes
- Captures different model perspectives
- Expected to improve generalization

**Weighting rationale:**
- XGBoost: 40% (best directional accuracy)
- LightGBM: 30% (fastest, good 1d performance)
- CatBoost: 30% (tied for best 7d directional)

**Implementation:**
- Load all 4 models for each horizon
- Generate 4 predictions
- Weighted average for final prediction
- ~3x inference time (negligible for daily predictions)

---

### üö´ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't use Random Forest for crypto prediction**
   - Severe overfitting
   - Poor directional accuracy
   - Use gradient boosting instead

2. **Don't rely solely on MAPE**
   - Directional accuracy matters for trading
   - R¬≤ near 0 is normal for crypto
   - Consider both metrics

3. **Don't ignore model diversity**
   - Single model = single point of failure
   - Ensemble reduces risk
   - Multiple perspectives improve robustness
