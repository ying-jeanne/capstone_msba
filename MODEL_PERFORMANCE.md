## 🎯 Model Quality Assessment

### Price Prediction Quality:
- **<2% MAPE** = ⭐ EXCELLENT (industry-leading)
- **2-5% MAPE** = ✅ GOOD (professional-grade)
- **5-10% MAPE** = ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (usable)
- **>10% MAPE** = ❌ POOR (needs improvement)

### Directional Accuracy (Trading Signal):
- **>52%** = ✅ Has predictive edge (profitable)
- **48-52%** = ⚠️ Random (no edge)
- **<48%** = ❌ Unreliable (inverse signal)

### R² Interpretation for Crypto:
- **Near 0 is NORMAL** for Bitcoin due to:
  - High volatility (random walk behavior)
  - Extreme market noise
  - Unpredictable external events
- Focus on **MAPE** (price accuracy) and **Directional Accuracy** (trading signal)

## 🚀 Best Models for Trading

### Short-Term Scalping (Intraday):
- **1-hour:** 0.24% MAPE - Perfect for quick trades
- **4-hour:** 0.49% MAPE - Excellent for day trading

### Medium-Term Swing Trading:
- **3-day:** 2.59% MAPE + 55.3% direction ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- **7-day:** 3.88% MAPE + 56.6% direction ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

### Position Trading (Longer-term):
- **24-hour:** 1.33% MAPE + 52.7% direction ✅ Bridge between hourly and daily
