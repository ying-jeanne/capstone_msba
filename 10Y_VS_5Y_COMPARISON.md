# Performance Comparison: 10-Year vs 5-Year Training Data

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Experiment:** Compare model performance using 10 years vs 5 years of historical data

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** More training data (10y) did **NOT** improve model performance. In fact, the 5-year model outperforms across all metrics.

**Recommendation:** **Continue using 5-year rolling window** for production predictions.

## Overall Averages

| Metric | 5-Year | 10-Year | Winner |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Avg Price MAPE | **2.67%** | 3.11% | üèÜ **5-Year** |
| Avg Directional Accuracy | **54.44%** | 53.70% | üèÜ **5-Year** |
| Training Samples | 1,136 | 2,415 | 10-Year (quantity) |

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Data Quality > Data Quantity

Despite having **112% more training data**, the 10-year model performs **worse** across all key metrics:
- Price MAPE increased by 0.44% (worse)
- Directional accuracy decreased by 0.74% (worse)

This suggests **recent data is more predictive** than distant historical data.

---

### 2. Market Regime Evolution

Bitcoin's market dynamics have evolved significantly over the past decade:

**2015-2020 Era (included in 10y, excluded from 5y):**
- Early adoption phase
- Wild volatility swings
- Different market participants
- Lower institutional involvement
- Lower overall liquidity

**2020-2025 Era (captured by 5y):**
- Institutional adoption
- More mature market structure
- Higher liquidity
- Different price drivers
- Current market regime

**Conclusion:** The 2015-2020 data introduces **noise** rather than **signal** for predicting 2025 prices.

---

### 3. Directional Signal Degradation

The 5-year model maintains a clearer directional edge:

| Horizon | 5y Edge over Random | 10y Edge over Random |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1-day | +1.43% | +0.48% |
| 3-day | +5.33% | +4.25% |
| 7-day | +6.56% | +6.37% |

The 1-day 10y model is particularly concerning - barely above random (50.48% vs 50%).

---

### 4. Price MAPE Degradation Pattern

The degradation increases with prediction horizon:

| Horizon | MAPE Increase | Relative Change |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1-day | +0.18% | +11.4% |
| 3-day | +0.46% | +17.8% |
| 7-day | +0.68% | +17.5% |

This suggests the distant historical data affects **longer-term patterns** more than short-term.

---

## Technical Analysis: Why Did 10y Perform Worse?

### 1. Non-Stationary Time Series
Bitcoin price dynamics are **non-stationary**:
- Market structure changes over time
- Different participants
- Regulatory environment evolution
- Technology improvements (Lightning Network, etc.)

Old patterns may **not apply** to current market.

---

### 2. Concept Drift
Machine learning models assume training and test data come from same distribution. Bitcoin violates this:
- 2015: $300 BTC, mostly retail
- 2020: $20k BTC, institutional entry
- 2025: $110k BTC, mature asset class

The model trained on 2015 data learns patterns that **no longer exist**.

---

### 3. Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- 5y data: Higher signal (recent relevant patterns)
- 10y data: Lower signal (diluted by irrelevant historical patterns)

More data only helps if it's **relevant data**.

---

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Continue using 5-year rolling window**
   - Best performance across all metrics
   - Captures current market regime
   - Better directional accuracy

2. **Do NOT switch to 10-year model**
   - Lower accuracy (3.11% vs 2.67% MAPE)
   - Weaker directional signal (53.70% vs 54.44%)

---

### For Model Improvements

1. **Add Market Regime Detection**
   ```
   - Classify current market: Bull/Bear/Sideways
   - Train separate models for each regime
   - Switch models based on detected regime
   ```

2. **Implement Time-Weighted Training**
   ```
   - Weight recent data more heavily
   - Exponential decay for older samples
   - Example: 2024 data = 1.0x weight, 2023 = 0.8x, 2022 = 0.6x
   ```

3. **Consider Ensemble Approach**
   ```
   - Combine 5y and 10y predictions
   - Weight 5y model more heavily (e.g., 70/30 split)
   - Capture both recent patterns and long-term cycles
   ```

4. **Implement Rolling Window Evaluation**
   ```
   - Test 3y, 4y, 5y, 6y windows
   - Find optimal window size dynamically
   - Update based on recent validation performance
   ```

---

## Conclusion

This experiment validates an important principle in time series forecasting: **More data ‚â† Better predictions**.

For Bitcoin price prediction:
- ‚úÖ **5-year window:** Optimal (2.67% MAPE, 54.44% directional)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **10-year window:** Suboptimal (3.11% MAPE, 53.70% directional)

**The 5-year model captures the current market regime without being diluted by outdated patterns from Bitcoin's early days.**
