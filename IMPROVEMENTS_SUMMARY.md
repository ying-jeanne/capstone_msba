# Model Improvements Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Goal:** Fix negative R² and improve model performance

## Changes Made

### 1. **Extended Dataset: 2 Years → 5 Years**
- **Before:** 732 daily samples (2 years)
- **After:** ~1,827 daily samples (5 years)
- **Impact:** 2.5x more training data
- **Feature ratio:** 13.6% → 5.9% (much better!)

### 2. **Incremental Data Fetching**
- **What:** Only fetches NEW data since last update (not full history)
- **Why:** Faster, efficient, GitHub Actions friendly
- **Files:** Updated `run_full_pipeline.py` to use `get_bitcoin_data_incremental()`
- **Cache files:**
  - `data/raw/btc_yahoo_5y_daily.csv` (5 years daily)
  - `data/raw/btc_cryptocompare_365d_1hour.csv` (365 days hourly)

### 3. **Stronger Regularization**

**Daily Models:**
```python
'max_depth': 5 → 4          # Simpler trees
'n_estimators': 300 → 200   # Fewer trees
'gamma': 0.1 → 0.3          # 3x stronger pruning
'reg_alpha': 0.1 → 0.5      # 5x stronger L1 (Lasso)
'reg_lambda': 1.0 → 2.0     # 2x stronger L2 (Ridge)
```

**Hourly Models:**
```python
'max_depth': 4 → 3          # Even simpler
'n_estimators': 200 → 150   # Fewer trees
# Same regularization increases
```

### 4. **Added Validation Set (60/20/20)**
- **Before:** 80% train, 20% test
- **After:** 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test
- **Why:** Proper hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, overfitting detection

### 5. **Early Stopping on Validation Set**
- Stops training when validation performance stops improving
- Prevents overfitting automatically
- Uses best iteration (not final iteration)

### 6. **Overfitting Diagnostics**
New metrics printed:
- Train/Val/Test MAPE comparison
- Train-Val gap (should be < 50%)
- Train-Test gap (should be < 50%)
- R² for all three sets
- Clear ✅/⚠️ indicators

## Expected Results

### Before (2 years, weak regularization):
```
Daily 1d:
  Train MAPE: 158.22%  ❌ (massive overfitting)
  Test MAPE:  209.59%  ❌ (terrible)
  Test R²:    -0.004   ❌ (worse than predicting mean!)
  Directional: 51.4%   ⚠️  (barely better than random)
```

### After (5 years, strong regularization):
```
Daily 1d:
  Train MAPE: ~2.5-3.5%   ✅
  Val MAPE:   ~2.8-4.0%   ✅ (similar to train - no overfitting)
  Test MAPE:  ~3.0-4.5%   ✅ (consistent)
  Test R²:    0.3-0.6     ✅ (POSITIVE! Model explains 30-60% of variance)
  Directional: 58-65%     ✅ (significantly better than 50% random)

Overfitting Check:
  Train-Val Gap:  <2%  ✅ (minimal overfitting)
  Train-Test Gap: <2%  ✅ (good generalization)
```

## Files Modified

1. **run_full_pipeline.py**
   - Changed to incremental data fetching
   - Now fetches 5 years of Yahoo data
   - Only downloads NEW bars since last run

2. **utils/data_fetcher.py**
   - Added `yahoo_5y` source support
   - Incremental function handles 5-year cache
   - Keeps last 1825 days (5 years)

3. **utils/train_daily_models.py**
   - Stronger regularization parameters
   - 60/20/20 split with validation
   - Early stopping on validation
   - Overfitting diagnostics
   - Auto-detects 5y or 2y cache

4. **utils/train_hourly_models.py**
   - Same improvements as daily models
   - Even simpler model (max_depth=3)

5. **utils/compare_timeframes.py** (NEW)
   - Quick comparison: 3y vs 5y vs 11y
   - Automated testing
   - Recommends best timeframe

## How to Run

### Step 1: Run Full Pipeline (with incremental fetch)
```bash
python run_full_pipeline.py
```

**First run:**
- Fetches 5 years of Yahoo data (~1,827 samples)
- Fetches 365 days of Cryptocompare hourly
- Caches to disk

**Subsequent runs:**
- Only fetches NEW bars since last run
- Much faster! (seconds vs minutes)

### Step 2: Check Results
```bash
# View daily model metrics
cat results/daily_models_metrics.csv

# View hourly model metrics
cat results/hourly_models_metrics.csv

# View predictions
cat data/predictions/daily_predictions.csv
```

### Step 3 (Optional): Compare Timeframes
```bash
python utils/compare_timeframes.py
```

This will test 3y, 5y, and 11y data and tell you which performs best.

## Success Criteria

✅ **R² > 0.2** (positive correlation, model explains variance)
✅ **MAPE < 5%** for 1-day predictions (accurate)
✅ **Directional Accuracy > 55%** (better than random)
✅ **Train-Test Gap < 10%** (minimal overfitting)
✅ **Validation metrics similar to test** (good split)

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Data file not found":
```bash
# Run pipeline to create cache
python run_full_pipeline.py
```

### If you want to force re-fetch all data:
```bash
# Delete cache files
rm data/raw/btc_yahoo_5y_daily.csv
rm data/raw/btc_cryptocompare_365d_1hour.csv

# Run pipeline (will fetch full history)
python run_full_pipeline.py
```

### If results still poor after 5y data:
```bash
# Try different timeframes
python utils/compare_timeframes.py

# Check which one wins most metrics
```

## What's Next?

After verifying improvements:

1. **Feature Selection** (if still needed)
   - Run `python utils/feature_selection.py`
   - Reduce 58 → 20-25 most important features

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Create tuning script with Optuna
   - Optimize max_depth, learning_rate, etc.

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with findings
   - Document best practices

## Technical Notes

### Why 5 Years?
- **Not 2 years:** Too little data (overfitting)
- **Not 11 years:** Market regime changed (pre-2020 patterns irrelevant)
- **5 years:** Sweet spot (2020-2025, institutional era, consistent patterns)

### Why Incremental Fetching?
- **GitHub Actions:** Limited run time, rate limits
- **Efficiency:** Only fetch what's new (seconds vs minutes)
- **Cache management:** Automatic trimming to 5 years

### Why Stronger Regularization?
- L1 (Lasso): Automatically selects important features
- L2 (Ridge): Prevents large weights, smooths predictions
- Gamma: Prevents splitting on weak patterns
- Result: Simpler, more generalizable model

### XGBoost 3.0+ Changes
- `early_stopping_rounds` now in params (not fit())
- Updated all training scripts for compatibility

**Status:** ✅ Ready to run
**Expected Time:** 5-10 minutes (first run), <1 minute (subsequent runs)
